If You wish to terminate Your&#10;Account, You may simply discontinue using the Service.&#10;Limitation of Liability&#10;Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its&#10;suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be&#10;limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased&#10;anything through the Service.&#10;To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable&#10;for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,&#10;damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury,&#10;loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party&#10;software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of&#10;this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and&#10;even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.&#10;Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or&#10;consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,&#10;each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.&#10;&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer&#10;The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without&#10;warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own&#10;behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly&#10;disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,&#10;including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and&#10;non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or&#10;trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and&#10;makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended&#10;results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without&#10;interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can&#10;or will be corrected.&#10;Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any&#10;representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the&#10;Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be&#10;uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content&#10;provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on&#10;behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other&#10;harmful components.&#10;Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable&#10;statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.&#10;But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest&#10;extent enforceable under applicable law.&#10;Governing Law&#10;The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the&#10;Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.&#10;Disputes Resolution&#10;If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally&#10;by contacting the Company.&#10;For European Union (EU) Users&#10;If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the&#10;country in which you are resident in.&#10;United States Legal Compliance&#10;You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States&#10;government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist&#10;supporting&quot; country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or&#10;restricted parties.&#10;Severability and Waiver&#10;Severability&#10;If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and&#10;interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable&#10;law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.&#10;Waiver&#10;Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under&#10;these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time&#10;thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.&#10;Changes to These Terms of Service&#10;We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is&#10;material We will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking&#10;effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Our sole discretion.&#10;By continuing to access or use Our Service after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound&#10;by the revised terms.
